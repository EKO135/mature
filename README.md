very mature malware
(btw this is just a joke)

i made this for literally no reason except dumb ass friends

run this:
```
  g++ dropper.cpp -o <any-name-you-fucking-want>
  g++ main.cpp -o main
```
if you dont have g++ as an envirnment variable then download MinGW and run this:
```
  path/to/MinGW/bin/g++.exe path/to/dropper.cpp -o path/for/executable
  path/to/MinGW/bin/g++.exe path/to/main.cpp -o path/for/main
```

if you dont understand what any of this shit means then dont bother. Oh and you need both files in the same directory

then simply run the dropper excutable and it will move the payload to startup

now you have a nice annoying thing to piss off ur friends (if you have any)

69!!!!
